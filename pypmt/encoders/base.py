    """!
    The main role of an Encoder is to receive a Unified Planning task and
    produce a SMT encoding.  This class is an interface for all encodings to
    implement.
    
    Typical encodings iteratively add layers (or timesteps) until the solver
    proves its satisfiability.  That is, finds a plan of a given number of
    steps. Therefore, encoders generally keep a record of which timesteps have
    been encoded.  Note that requirements of some encodings will leave some
    methods unimplemented if they do not need them.
